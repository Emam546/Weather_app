# Weather API Project

This is a simple weather API project created for learning purposes. The project uses several Node.js dependencies to handle requests, caching, and rate limiting.

## Dependencies

The following dependencies are used in this project:

- `apicache`: Caching library for caching responses.
- `cors`: Middleware for enabling Cross-Origin Request Sharing (CORS).
- `dotenv`: Loads environment variables from a `.env` file.
- `express`: Web framework for building the API.
- `express-rate-limit`: Middleware to limit repeated requests to public APIs.
- `needle`: HTTP client for making API requests to weather services.

## Features

- Implements caching to improve response times for repeated requests.
- Uses rate limiting to avoid exceeding the API usage limits.
